## Oracle - 2020

A floating installation commissioned by Hull City Council and built by [Kazimier Productions](https://www.invisiblewindfactory.com/kazimier/projects/oracle/). It interpreted Met Office forecasts and real time weather data from on board sensors to produce a performance with sound, light and lasers.

I used Arduino and Raspberry Pi hardware to control the system along with MQTT for data transfer to collect weather data from on board sensors and the web. This drove the lighting and sound for the installation.
