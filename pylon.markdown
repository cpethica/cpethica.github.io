## Pylon

A MIDI operated cymbal crashing sculpture built with Kazimier Productions for [Forest Swords](https://forestswords.co.uk/projects/pylon-percussion-sculpture), commissioned by FutureYard festival in Birkenhead.

The sculpture was installed in Birkenhead Priory monastery with local artists invited to program their own music for it.

I designed a custom PCB for this project to allow the use of high power solenoids and to simplify the wiring and build.
