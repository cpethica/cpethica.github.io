I designed and built a control system for a mechanically controlled gamelan instrument. 24 mechanical beaters were used to sound custom made chimes and could either play pre-recorded music or be MIDI controlled. This allowed musicians to take control of the instrument for themselves. I also built a touch sensitive MIDI keyboard that allowed festival audiences to play the Hive for themselves.
