## The Kronos - 2015

I worked with Venya Krutikov and Kazimier Productions to produce a New Yearsâ€™ Eve spectacle for the closing night of the Kazimier club in Liverpool. We built the electronics and control system for a 3m tall spaceship sculpture with eight linear actuator-controlled arms that lifted to reveal a mirrored body covered in thousands of independently controlled LED lights. It was suspended over the club at midnight on NYE complete with pyrotechnics in the wings and a theatrical performance to introduce it.

A major upgrade allowed us to take the Kronos (with a crew inside!) to festival no 6 in 2016.
