## Xmas Tree - 2020

Lighting design and build for a sculpture by [Faith Bebbington](https://faithbebbington.co.uk) for Kings Cross station.

I integrated a tap to donate terminal into the design again. Donations to the charity Shelter would trigger a rotating fairy on the top of the tree and display different lighting modes.
